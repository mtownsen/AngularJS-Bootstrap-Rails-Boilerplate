[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jakemmarsh/angularjs-gulp-browserify-boilerplate.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jakemmarsh/angularjs-gulp-browserify-boilerplate) [![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/jakemmarsh/angularjs-gulp-browserify-boilerplate/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/jakemmarsh/angularjs-gulp-browserify-boilerplate#info=devDependencies)

A boilerplate using AngularJS, SASS, Gulp, and Browserify that also utilizes [these best AngularJS practices](https://github.com/toddmotto/angularjs-styleguide)  and Gulp best practices from [this resource](https://github.com/greypants/gulp-starter) based on [this popular boilerplate](https://github.com/jakemmarsh/angularjs-gulp-browserify-boilerplate)

### Getting up and running

1. Clone this repo from `https://github.com/jakemmarsh/angularjs-gulp-browserify-boilerplate.git`
2. Run `npm install` from the root directory
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Your browser will automatically be opened and directed to the browser-sync proxy address
5. To prepare assets for production, run the `npm run build` script (Note: the production task does not fire up the express server, and won't provide you with browser-sync's live reloading. Simply use `npm run dev` during development. More information below)

Now that `npm run dev` is running, the server is up as well and serving files from the `/build` directory. Any changes in the `/app` directory will be automatically processed by Gulp and the changes will be injected to any open browsers pointed at the proxy address.

---

This boilerplate uses the latest versions of the following libraries:

- [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/)
- [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
- [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)

Along with many Gulp libraries (these can be seen in either `package.json`, or at the top of each task in `/gulp/tasks/`).

### AngularJS

AngularJS is a MVW (Model-View-Whatever) Javascript Framework for creating single-page web applications. In this boilerplate, it is used for all the application routing as well as all of the frontend views and logic.

The AngularJS files are all located within `/app/js`, structured in the following manner:

```
/controllers
  index.js   (the main module on which all controllers will be mounted, loaded in main.js)
  example.js
/directives
  index.js   (the main module on which all directives will be mounted, loaded in main.js)
  example.js
/filters
  index.js (the main module on which all filters will be mounted, loaded in main.js)
  example.js
/services
  index.js   (the main module on which all services will be mounted, loaded in main.js)
  example.js
constants.js  (any constant values that you want to make available to Angular)
main.js       (the main file read by Browserify, also where the application is defined and bootstrapped)
on_run.js     (any functions or logic that need to be executed on app.run)
on_config.js  (all route definitions and any logic that need to be executed on app.config)
templates.js  (this is created via Gulp by compiling your views, and will not be present beforehand)
```

##### Testing

A Gulp tasks also exists for running the test framework (discussed in detail below). Running `gulp test` will run any and all tests inside the `/test` directory and show the results (and any errors) in the terminal.

### Testing

This boilerplate also includes a simple framework for unit and end-to-end (e2e) testing via [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) and [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/). In order to test AngularJS modules, the [angular.mocks](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngMock/object/angular.mock) module is used.

All of the tests can be run at once with the command `npm test`. However, the tests are broken up into two main categories:

##### End-to-End (e2e) Tests

e2e tests, as hinted at by the name, consist of tests that involve multiple modules or require interaction between modules, similar to integration tests. These tests are carried out using the Angular library [Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor), which also utilizes Jasmine. The goal is to ensure that the flow of your application is performing as designed from start to finish.

In this boilerplate, two end-to-end test examples are provided:

- `routes_spec.js`, which tests the functionality of our AngularJS routing
- `example_spec.js`, which tests the functionality of the example route, controller, and view

More examples can be seen at the above link for Protractor.

All e2e tests are run with `npm run protractor`.

##### Unit Tests

Unit tests are used to test a single module (or "unit") at a time in order to ensure that each module performs as intended individually. In AngularJS this could be thought of as a single controller, directive, filter, service, etc. That is how the unit tests are organized in this boilerplate.

An example test is provided for the following types of AngularJS modules:

- `unit/controllers/example_spec.js`
- `unit/services/example_spec.js`
- `unit/directives/example_spec.js`
- `unit/constants_spec.js`

All unit tests are run with `npm run unit`. When running unit tests, code coverage is simultaneously calculated and output as an HTML file to the `/coverage` directory.
